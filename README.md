# Vibecoding Experiments

A collection of experimental HTML/JavaScript projects and prototypes created during creative coding sessions.

## Contents

This repository serves as an archive of various web-based experiments and tools:

- **3d-studio-explorer.html** - 3D visualization and exploration tool
- **inventory.html** - Inventory management interface
- **python-microcontroller-ide.py** - Python-based microcontroller development environment
- **single_html/** - Directory of standalone HTML experiments

## Purpose

This is a "dump repository" for:
- Quick prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- Experimental UI/UX ideas
- Creative coding sessions
- Learning experiments
- Tools that might be useful later

## Usage

Each file is generally self-contained and can be opened directly in a web browser (for HTML files) or run with Python (for .py files).

```bash
# For HTML files
open 3d-studio-explorer.html

# For Python scripts
python python-microcontroller-ide.py
```

## Note

These are experimental projects and may not be fully functional or documented. They represent snapshots of creative coding sessions and exploratory development.
