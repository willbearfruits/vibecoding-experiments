# Vibecoding Experiments

A collection of experimental HTML/JavaScript projects and prototypes created during creative coding sessions.

## Live Demo

- GitHub Pages: https://willbearfruits.github.io/vibecoding-experiments/
- Library: https://willbearfruits.github.io/vibecoding-experiments/library/

## Contents

This repository serves as an archive of various web-based experiments and tools:

- **3d-studio-explorer.html** - 3D visualization and exploration tool
- **inventory.html** - Inventory management interface
- **python-microcontroller-ide.py** - Python-based microcontroller development environment
- **single_html/** - Directory of standalone HTML experiments

## Purpose

This is a "dump repository" for:
- Quick prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- Experimental UI/UX ideas
- Creative coding sessions
- Learning experiments
- Tools that might be useful later

## Usage

Each file is generally self-contained and can be opened directly in a web browser (for HTML files) or run with Python (for .py files).

```bash
# For HTML files
open 3d-studio-explorer.html

# For Python scripts
python python-microcontroller-ide.py
```

## Note

These are experimental projects and may not be fully functional or documented. They represent snapshots of creative coding sessions and exploratory development.

Personal names and identifiers have been scrubbed from project-facing content where found.
